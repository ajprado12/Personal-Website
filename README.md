Summary 

For this being my first actual project, I can say I am excited and happy about it. HTML and CSS are simple enough to understand, but the challenges I faced lied in the approach.

To begin, I had a hard time getting use to just typing away without looking at a ton of video on styling and page structure. Since changing my way of thinking and approach I have managed to find it easier to find better ways to structure and style.
